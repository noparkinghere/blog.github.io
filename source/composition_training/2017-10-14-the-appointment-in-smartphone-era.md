We can see four people in the picture and it is just time for dinner, however they are absorbed in their smartphones.The four people are doing different things by phone. It seems that a man is entertaining himself, a woman is enjoying music and other people's behavior cannot be guessed according to the picture.

Seemingly some phenomena that more and more people are addicted to their tools is becoming common in these years,thanks to our repaid development of technology and revolution of information.As far as I am concerned,smartphone has beyonded computer and become the greatest invention in the history,as it can assist us doing various things from work to entertainment.

In my opinion,using smartphone at an appointment is reasonable nowadays.Playing smartphone can relieve us from embarrass,especially when we have an appointment with strangers or some old friend that we haven't met for many years.In addition,with games like mobile legend being fashionable,playing smartphone games has been a universal social interaction and it can help me know others more.But if you have a dinner with the elders,I don't advise you to play smartphone.
